## State location

This is a stateless knowledge skill. It does not create, read, or modify local configuration or persistent state files.

## When to Use

User asks about Vienna for visiting, moving, working, studying, or starting a business. Establish role, timeline, budget, and district constraints first, then load only the needed reference files.

## When to Load References

Determine the user's role (tourist, resident, tech worker, student, entrepreneur) and load the appropriate reference files:

## Core Rules

### 1. Identify User Context First
- **Role**: Tourist, resident, tech worker, student, entrepreneur
- **Timeline**: Short visit, planning to move, already there
- Load relevant auxiliary file for details

### 2. Safety Context
Vienna is one of the world's safest major cities, consistently ranking #1 for quality of life. Main considerations:
- Very low violent crime rate
- Some pickpocketing at tourist spots (Stephansplatz, metro stations)
- Occasional phone snatching on U-Bahn
- Safe to walk alone at night in most areas
See `references/safety.md` for area-specific guidance.

### 3. Weather Expectations
- Continental climate — cold winters, warm summers
- Summer: Warm (25-32°C), occasional heatwaves
- Winter: Cold (−2 to 5°C), occasional snow
- Best months: May-June, September
- Christmas markets: Late November-December

### 4. Current Data (Feb 2026)

| Item | Range |
|------|-------|
| 1BR rent | €900-1,500 (central), €600-1,000 (outer) |
| Senior SWE salary | €55K-90K total comp |
| Student budget | €900-1,300/month |
| Monthly transit pass | €51 (annual €365) |

### 5. Tourist Traps
- Skip: Restaurants on Stephansplatz (overpriced), Prater's overpriced food stalls
- Do: Naschmarkt, Neubau (7th), Karmelitermarkt, traditional Beisln (local taverns)

### 6. Cultural Notes
Vienna has distinct characteristics that differ from other German-speaking cities:
- **Coffeehouses are institutions** — staying hours with one coffee is expected and welcome
- **Grüß Gott** — standard greeting (not "Hallo")
- **Austrians ≠ Germans** — cultural differences are significant, treat them as distinct
- **Indirect communication** — Viennese are more indirect than Germans
- **Title usage** — academic titles matter (Herr Doktor, Frau Magister)
- **Sunday closures** — most shops closed, restaurants and cafés open

### 7. Language
- Official: German (Austrian German, with distinct vocabulary)
- English widely spoken in tourist areas, universities, tech companies
- Some useful Austrian terms:
  - Servus = Hello/Goodbye (informal)
  - Grüß Gott = Hello (formal)
  - Melange = Cappuccino
  - Beisl = Traditional tavern
  - Heuriger = Wine tavern
  - Schmäh = Viennese humor/charm
