## University & Education Hub

Utrecht is first and foremost a university city:
- **Utrecht University**: Top 100 globally, 30,000+ students
- **HKU (University of the Arts)**: Major arts/design school
- **Hogeschool Utrecht**: Applied sciences, 37,000+ students
- **International schools**: Several options in surrounding area

The student population shapes the city's culture: vibrant nightlife, affordable food options, and cycling infrastructure designed for mass daily commutes.

## Dutch-Specific Traps

- **Housing desperation** — View the property in person before transferring money. Housing scams are common.
- **Registration required** — You cannot get a BSN (citizen service number) without registered housing.
- **Catch-22** — Many services need BSN, but BSN needs registered address. Plan in advance.
- **Cycling rules** — No lights = €70 fine. Wrong way on bike lane = accident risk.
- **Direct communication** — Dutch directness is cultural, not rude; treat it as informational, not hostile.
- **Agenda culture** — Dutch plan everything weeks ahead. Spontaneous visits are rare.
- **Store hours** — Many shops closed Sundays and Mondays. Supermarkets more flexible.
- **Tipping minimal** — 5-10% is generous. Rounding up is common and acceptable.
- **Weather layers** — Dress in layers year-round. Rain can start anytime.
- **Bike theft** — Two locks minimum. Expensive bikes attract thieves.

## Legal Awareness

Key laws visitors/residents must know:
- **Soft drugs**: Cannabis technically illegal but tolerated in licensed coffeeshops (not common in Utrecht compared to Amsterdam)
- **Hard drugs**: Zero tolerance. Possession/sale is criminal offense.
- **Alcohol**: Legal at 18. No public intoxication.
- **Cycling infractions**: Fines for no lights (€70), wrong way (€110), phone use (€150)
- **ID requirement**: Must carry ID if 14+. €110 fine if unable to identify.
- **Noise regulations**: Strict, especially in residential areas. Neighbors will complain.
- **Tenant rights**: Strong protections, but landlord disputes common for expats.

See `references/safety.md` for comprehensive legal guidance.
