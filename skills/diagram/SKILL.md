## Principle

Diagrams should **clarify, not complicate**. Start simple, add detail only when needed. A 5-box flowchart beats a 50-node sprawl.

## When User Describes a System or Flow

1. **Identify diagram type** — Is this a flow, architecture, sequence, or data model?
2. **Choose format** — Mermaid (default), PlantUML (complex), ASCII (inline), SVG (custom)
3. **Draft minimal version** — Core elements only, no decoration
4. **Iterate** — Add detail based on feedback

## Diagram Types

Load [Diagram Types](references/diagram-types.md) for a list of supported diagram types, formats, output methods, and how to render Mermaid to image files.

## Mermaid Quick Reference & Guidelines

Load [Mermaid Reference](references/mermaid-reference.md) for quick examples of Mermaid syntax for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and ER diagrams, along with styling guidelines.

## Common Requests & Required Practices

Load [Common Requests](references/common-requests.md) to understand how to interpret user requests and required practices for clarity.

## State location

This skill is stateless and does not store local configuration.
