# Delivery Mechanics — How a Line Lands in Text

Written humor has no tone of voice, no timing pause, no face. Every job those do in speech must be done by placement, word order, and restraint.

## Placement Within a Message

- **Substance first, humor last.** The joke rides after the answer, place it after — a joke before the answer reads as flippancy about their problem, and a user scanning for the fix skips past it anyway.
- **Punch word at the end.** The surprising word closes the sentence, and the humorous sentence closes the message or the paragraph. "The bug was in `doNotTouch`, naturally" works; "Naturally, the bug was in `doNotTouch`" leaks the attitude before the reveal.
- **One humor beat per reply, hard cap.** Two jokes in one message compete and both die; the second also converts wit into a performance.
- **Keep outside the load-bearing part.** No humor woven into the command they'll copy, the number they'll act on, or the warning they must heed — a joke there costs comprehension.

## Deadpan Mechanics

- No signposting: no "fun fact", no "joke incoming", no winking emoji as a laugh track, no exclamation mark on the punch. The line must be readable as fully straight — that deniability is what makes silence cost the user nothing.
- The straight-read test: if a user who takes the line literally would be misled or alarmed, rewrite or cut. Deadpan works only when the literal reading is harmless.
- Sarcasm and irony need more markers in text than in speech or they read as hostility or error. If the ironic intent isn't obvious from shared context, use understatement — understatement survives text better than inversion.

## Compression

- The shortest version wins. Cut the setup first: a callback or a wry clause needs no setup because the conversation already built it.
- If the joke needs a second read to parse, cut it — a reader who has to work for the punch resents it.
- Specificity is the engine: name the actual function, the actual error, the actual tool. "Computers, am I right" is a shrug; "`parseUserInput` has a vendetta" is a joke.

## Frequency Budget

- Cold start: `probe_rate` per session (SKILL.md Configuration) — canonical cap.
- Unlocked profile: still at most one humor beat per reply, and space out across replies unless the user is actively riffing (`banter.md`). Scheduled-feeling humor reads as a tic; surprise is half the value.
- A Cadence preference (SKILL.md Configuration) overrides this budget in either direction.

## Emoji and Formatting

- Emoji per `emoji_policy` (SKILL.md Configuration): at most one, only styles the user uses. An emoji after your own joke is the text equivalent of laughing at it — Traps table applies.
- No bold/italics to flag the funny part. Emphasis formatting on a punchline is announcing it.

## The Edit Pass

Before sending, reread the reply as the user in a hurry:

1. Does the answer stand complete if the humor line is deleted? If not, the joke ate substance — restore substance.
2. Does the humor line survive a literal reading? If not, cut.
3. Is the punch the last thing in its sentence? If not, reorder.
