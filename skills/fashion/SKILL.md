## Core Rules

### 1. Ask Context Before Advising
Provide specific, tailored advice. First establish:
- **Body**: Height, build, proportions (short torso? broad shoulders?)
- **Budget**: Actual spending limit (€50/month ≠ €500/month)
- **Lifestyle**: Job type, commute, physical activity, kids?
- **Environment**: Industry dress codes, climate, cultural context
- **Constraints**: Mobility needs, nursing, medical devices, sensory sensitivities

### 2. Work With What They Have
Before suggesting purchases, ask what's already in their wardrobe. Build outfits from existing pieces first. "Buy a blazer" is useless when they need to get dressed NOW.

### 3. Body Proportions Over Generic Types
Use specific measurements instead of "apple/pear" labels. Ask specifics:
- Shoulder-to-hip ratio
- Torso vs leg length
- Where waist naturally sits

Apply visual balancing: high-rise elongates short legs, V-necks balance broad shoulders. See `references/styling.md` for proportion rules.

### 4. Practical Constraints Are Non-Negotiable
Always factor in:
- **Mobility**: Can they run, squat, sit for hours?
- **Care**: Machine-washable or dry-clean? Ironing capacity?
- **Climate**: Actual temperature + indoor/outdoor transitions
- **Budget**: Not just price, but cost-per-wear math

### 5. One Recommendation, Not Options (When Asked)
If someone needs to get dressed in 5 minutes, give ONE answer, not five choices. Decision fatigue is real. Save options for when they're exploring.

### 6. Confidence Over "Flattering"
Frame advice around celebrating their shape. Focus on what makes them feel powerful, comfortable, and like themselves. "This celebrates your shape" not "This hides your stomach."

### 7. Context-Specific Dress Codes
"Business casual" varies wildly:
- Tech startup BC ≠ Law firm BC ≠ Finance BC
- NYC smart casual ≠ Austin smart casual
- Always ask industry, company culture, and specific venue

## Adaptation Rules

### For Different Bodies
- **Plus-size**: See `references/users.md` — know actual brand size ranges, avoid "hide your body" defaults
- **Petite**: Translate standard lengths (their "midi" = your maxi), prioritize proportion
- **Tall**: Inseam/sleeve length sourcing, proportion balancing
- **Adaptive needs**: Seated proportions, closure types, medical device access

### For Different Lifestyles
- **Parents**: Stain-camo fabrics, movement-friendly, 2-minute outfit decisions
- **Travelers**: Wrinkle-resistant fabrics, layering systems, carry-on constraints
- **Budget-limited**: Thrift strategy, repair skills, cost-per-wear prioritization
- **Minimalists**: Uniform approach, single-answer decisions, no browsing

### For Different Cultures
- **Non-Western**: Traditional-modern fusion, modesty as mainstream, regional brands
- **Religious requirements**: Build WITH the requirement, don't suggest removing it
- **Regional codes**: What's appropriate varies by city, industry, generation

## Shopping Traps

- Cross-brand sizing varies wildly — Zara runs 1-2 sizes smaller than H&M
- "Original price" is often fake — item may have never sold at that price
- "Free returns" may mean fee deducted from refund
- "Sustainable" without certifications (GOTS, B Corp) = probably greenwashing
- Sale timing: winter coats cheapest in Feb, swimwear in Sept

## Fabric Traps

- Under 150 GSM t-shirts are see-through; 180+ is substantial
- Cotton base layers in cold = dangerous (retains moisture)
- "Vegan leather" = usually plastic with worse longevity
- Linen wrinkles badly; merino wool travels well
- "Dry clean only" is a lifestyle cost, not just a care label

## Trend Guidance

Recommend trends only when accompanied by their lifecycle context:
- **Emerging**: Runway only, not yet retail
- **Ascending**: Street style adoption, entering stores
- **Peak**: Fast fashion saturation — already over for early adopters
- **Declining**: Ironic use only

State which phase. See `references/styling.md` for aesthetic distinctions (old money ≠ quiet luxury ≠ mob wife).

## State location
This skill is stateless and does not store local configuration or state in `<state_root>`.
