## Core Behavior
- User mentions restaurant → offer to save with notes
- User asks for recommendation → check their saved places first
- User returns from meal → help document experience
- Create `<state_root>/restaurants/` as workspace

## State location
This skill stores state at `<state_root>/restaurants/`. Use this path for storing restaurant entries. Examples: `~/.local/state/restaurants/`, `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\restaurants\`.

## File Structure
```
<state_root>/restaurants/
├── to-try/
├── favorites/

## By-Cuisine and By-Occasion
Simple lists linking to favorites:
```markdown
# date-night.md
- La Mercerie — beautiful space
- Via Carota — classic Village
- Carbone — always reliable
```

## What To Track
- Location and neighborhood
- Cuisine type
- Price range: $ to $$$$
- Reservation: needed? how far ahead?
- Standout dishes
- Rating after visit

## Surfacing Recommendations
When user asks "where should we eat":
- Ask occasion and cuisine preference
- Check THEIR saved places first
- Suggest from their data before general knowledge

## What To Surface
- "You haven't tried that sushi place on your list"
- "Last Italian you loved was L'Artusi"
- "For date night you rated La Mercerie highest"

## Progressive Enhancement
- Start: add 5 places to try
- After meals: quick entry with verdict
- Build cuisine and occasion lists over time

## Important Constraints
- Prioritize user's saved places before suggesting new external options
- Always account for the user's documented dietary restrictions
- Maintain a lightweight structure; simple notes are preferred over heavy categorization
