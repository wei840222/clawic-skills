## State location

Organization preferences are persistent user state. Before reading or writing them, resolve `<state_root>` once for this invocation:

1. Use a user- or host-configured state root when one is explicitly provided.
2. Otherwise use the first existing directory in this order: `<workspace>/organize/`, `<workspace>/memory/organize/`, then `~/organize/`.
3. If more than one candidate exists, use only the highest-precedence directory and report the duplicate state locations; do not merge or synchronize them.
4. If none exists and the user confirms saving a preference, create `<workspace>/organize/`. If `<workspace>` is unavailable, ask for a state root instead of guessing from the current directory.

Use the selected `<state_root>` for every preference read or write. Store learned preferences at `<state_root>/patterns.md`; use `references/patterns.md` only as the bundled starting convention, never as mutable user state.

## Core operation

Use this skill when creating, naming, grouping, moving, or reviewing files and directories where a durable structure matters.

Organization isn't a separate task—it happens while you work. Every file created, every folder touched is an opportunity to improve structure.

For organization fundamentals, load `references/principles.md`; for cross-platform naming or repository-size constraints, load `references/organization-research.md`. Before proposing a structure, read `<state_root>/patterns.md` when a resolved state root contains saved preferences; otherwise use `references/patterns.md` as the starting convention.

## Proactive Triggers

Organize when you notice:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Creating a new file | Propose location based on saved preferences |
| Multiple related files | Suggest grouping structure |
| Naming something | Apply naming conventions from `patterns.md` |
| Searching takes effort | Propose reorganization |
| Pattern emerging | Document in `<state_root>/patterns.md` after confirmation |

## The Organization Loop

1. **OBSERVE** — Notice structure while working.
2. **PROPOSE** — Suggest improvement before acting.
3. **CONFIRM** — Get explicit OK (until pattern confirmed).
4. **APPLY** — Organize, document what you did.
5. **LEARN** — Record the confirmed preference in `<state_root>/patterns.md`.

Always propose a structure change first and wait for explicit confirmation. Automatically apply patterns only after they have been confirmed.

## Proposal Formats

**For new items:**
```
📁 Organization suggestion
I'm about to [create/move/rename] [item].
Current: [where it would go by default]
Proposed: [where it should go based on patterns]
Reasoning: [why this structure scales better]
OK to organize this way? (Say "always for X" to skip future asks)
```

**For reorganization:**
```
📁 Reorganization proposal
Problem: [what's inefficient now]
Impact: [how it affects access/scale]
Proposed change:
- [specific moves/renames]
Effort: [minimal/moderate/significant]
Risk: [what could break]
Should I proceed?
```

## Scale Thinking

Before placing anything, ask:

- **10x test:** If this grows 10x, does the structure hold?
- **Access pattern:** How will this be found later? By whom?
- **Related items:** What will live near this? Group accordingly.
- **Lifecycle:** Will this be archived? Deleted? Versioned?

## Learning Preferences

Track confirmations:

| Pattern | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Seen once | Note, still ask |
| Confirmed 2x | Tentative, still ask |
| "Always do this" | Auto-apply, stop asking |
| "Never do this" | Avoid, record in `<state_root>/patterns.md` |

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Recommended Action |
|-------|------------|
| Reorganize silently | Always propose first |
| Organize in bulk later | Organize while working |
| Structure for today only | Think 10x ahead |
| Assume preferences | Confirm, then record |
| Same structure for everything | Adapt to content type |
