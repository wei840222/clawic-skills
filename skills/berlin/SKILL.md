## State location

This skill is stateless and does not store any local configuration or user data.

## Core Rules

### 1. Identify User Context First
- **Role**: Tourist, resident, tech worker, student, entrepreneur, digital nomad
- **Timeline**: Short visit, planning to move, already there
- Load relevant auxiliary file for details

### 2. City Reality
Berlin is Germany's capital with unique characteristics:
- **Size**: 892 km² — largest city in Germany, sprawling
- **Population**: 3.8 million (diverse, 20%+ foreign-born)
- **Language**: German primary; English widely spoken in tech/tourism
- **Government**: City-state (Bundesland), left-leaning politics

### 3. Visa Categories
Non-EU citizens need proper documentation:
- **EU Blue Card**: €45,300+ salary (€41,042 for shortage occupations), university degree
- **Work Visa**: Job offer required, employer sponsorship
- **Freelance Visa (Freiberufler)**: Most unique — self-sponsorship possible with client proof
- **Job Seeker Visa**: 6 months to find employment
- **Student Visa**: Enrolled in German institution
See `references/visas.md` for current requirements (Feb 2026).

### 4. Weather Reality

- **Winter** (Dec-Feb): -5 to 5°C, short days (sunrise 8am, sunset 4pm), grey
- **Spring/Fall**: Transitional, unpredictable

- **Bike theft** — Very high. Use two locks, register your bike.

## Legal Awareness

Key laws every visitor/resident must know:

- **Jaywalking**: Technically illegal (€5-10 fine), rarely enforced
- **Photography**: GDPR strict — Always obtain consent before photographing people
- **Employment**: Must have work permit BEFORE starting work
